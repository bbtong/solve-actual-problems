# TL;DR of Hammock Driven Development

1. State the problem
2. Understand the context: facts, constraints, budgets, timeframes
3. Document what you _don't_ know
4. Brainstorm solutions of all levels and scale
5. Understand trade-offs and narrow solutions
6. Have _at least 2 alternatives_ to be a trade-off and get outside opinion
7. Active mind: focus be analytical and "on" during the workday
8. Background mind: connects abstractions, strategies, pipelines as you sleep
9. Allow your background mind to wander, but timebox this problem to a day of work
10. A day of work means 7 +- 2 hours
11. _Hammock time!_ is essentially meditation - imagine your problem with your eyes closed
12. Wait at least overnight or even longer for pioneering questions and move on with tasks
13. Keep an easy way to write notes near you
14. Capture those flashes of brilliance when they appear
15. Reference notes and try implementing them through fast iteration
16. Collect feedback on small solution, improve / iterate, repeat
17. You may be wrong - don't be scared of it
18. ???
19. Success
